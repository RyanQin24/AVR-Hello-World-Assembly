# AVR-Hello-World-Assembly

This is my first code written in assembly for an Atmega328p(AVR architecture). It prints hello world on a 16 x 2 LCD. 

Attached in this repository is the source code, logic analyzer file (.sr and jpeg for those who don't have pulseview), and shematic.

Message to future engineers:

**Low level programming is a must for deeply understanding computer architecture. It may be intimidating at first but take your time with practicing 
port registers and shift registers before going into assembly.**
